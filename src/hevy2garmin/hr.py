"""Heart-rate sourcing + merging for FIT enrichment.

hevy2garmin can enrich an uploaded workout with heart rate from more than one
source, in priority order:

1. **In-workout HR recorded by Hevy** (e.g. AirPods Pro 3 in-ear HR, which Hevy
   captures via Apple HealthKit). This is the most consistent during a lift, but
   only present when the user wore a recording device for that session — and
   only when Hevy actually exposes it (see ``extract_hevy_hr``).
2. **Matched Garmin activity HR** from the watch-recorded FIT file. This is the
   preferred source for replacement uploads and is typically sampled every
   second.
3. **Garmin daily passive HR** (wrist monitoring, ~every couple of minutes).
   Usually available if the user wears the watch, but coarser.

``merge_hr_sources`` combines them: the higher-priority source wins wherever it
has a sample, and the lower-priority source fills the gaps. The result is a
timestamped ``[{"time": secs_from_start, "hr": bpm}]`` series that
``fit.generate_fit`` embeds at real offsets.
